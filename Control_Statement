#Introduction:- In Python, statements in the program are executed one after another in the order in which they are written. This is called sequential execution of the program.

                 # But in some situation programmer may need to alter the normal flow of the execution of a program or to perform the same operations a number of times.

                 #For this purpose python provides a control structure which transfers the control from one part of the program to same other part of the program.


#Types of Control Statement:-There are three types of control Statements.
                        #   1) Sequential Execution:- Is when statements are executed one after another in order n sequential manner..
                        
                        #   2) Selection statements:- It is also known as decision control statements or branching statements. It allows the program to test several conditions and execute instructions based on which condition is true.
                        # A loop or iterative control structure allows the execution of a block of statements multiple times until a specified condition is met..
                        
                        #   3) Repetition statement:- It is used to repeat a group of programming instructions..
